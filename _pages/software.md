# `pinta`
[`pinta`](https://github.com/abhisrkckl/pinta) is a data reduction pipeline for pulsar data taken using the upgraded [Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope](https://gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/) (uGMRT).
It takes the uGMRT raw pulsar data as input, does RFI mitigation and folding, and gives partially folded profile archives as output.
It will be commissioned as an observatory pipeline at GMRT soon. 
This pipeline was described in [this paper](/publication/2021-04-14-pinta-paper).
