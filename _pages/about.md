Hello! 
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [National Centre for Radio Astrophysics](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main) in Pune, India. 
I am a member of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array collaboration and the [International Pulsar Timing Array](http://ipta4gw.org/) consortium.
I did my PhD from [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/) in Mumbai, India.
My research focuses on nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy using Pulsar Timing Arrays. 
I am especially interested in astrophysical sources of nanohertz gravitational waves, pulsar timing, and developing software for astrophysical applications.
