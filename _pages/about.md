Hello! 
I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Gravitation, Cosmology & Astrophysics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://cgca.uwm.edu/index.html). 
I work on gravitational waves and pulsars.
I used to work as a postdoc at [National Centre for Radio Astrophysics](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main) in Pune, India. 
I am a member of the [Indian Pulsar Timing Array](http://inpta.iitr.ac.in/) collaboration and the [International Pulsar Timing Array](http://ipta4gw.org/) consortium.

I did my PhD from [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/) in Mumbai, India. 
You can find my PhD thesis [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28080.64008). 

My research focuses on nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy using Pulsar Timing Arrays. 
I am especially interested in astrophysical sources of nanohertz gravitational waves, pulsar timing, and developing software for astrophysical applications.
