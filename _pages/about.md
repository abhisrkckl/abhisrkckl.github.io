Hello! I am an astrophysicist working on gravitational waves and pulsars. 
My research focuses on nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy using Pulsar Timing Arrays. 
I am especially interested in astrophysical sources of nanohertz gravitational waves, pulsar timing, and developing software for astrophysical applications.

I did my bachelors at [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://iist.ac.in/) and PhD at [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/). 
You can find my PhD thesis [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28080.64008) and [here](http://hdl.handle.net/10603/370757). 

I work as an Assistant Professor at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). 
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute)](https://www.aei.mpg.de/), [Center for Gravitation, Cosmology & Astrophysics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://cgca.uwm.edu/index.html), and the [National Centre for Radio Astrophysics](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main),
and as a Scientist/Engineer at [Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre](https://www.lpsc.gov.in/). 

I am a member of the [Indian Pulsar Timing Array](http://inpta.iitr.ac.in/) collaboration, the [NANOGrav](http://nanograv.org/) collaboration, and the [International Pulsar Timing Array](http://ipta4gw.org/) consortium.
